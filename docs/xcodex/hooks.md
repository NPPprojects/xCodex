# xcodex hooks (automation)

xcodex includes an “automation hooks” system: it emits lifecycle events and can either:

- spawn one-shot external commands (default),
- stream events to a long-lived “py-box” host process (recommended for stateful Python), or
- run an experimental in-process PyO3 hook bridge (advanced; separate build).

Hooks are **observer-only** and **fire-and-forget**: failures are logged and do not block or modify the run.

The authoritative configuration reference is `docs/config.md#hooks`.

## Hook modes (pick one)

| Mode | What it is | When to use | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| External hooks (spawn per event) | Spawn a command for each event; payload JSON on stdin (envelope for large payloads) | Safest/most portable; easiest to debug | `docs/xcodex/hooks-external.md` |
| Python Host hooks (“py-box”, long-lived) | One long-lived process receives hook events as JSONL | Stateful Python hooks without per-event spawn overhead | `docs/xcodex/hooks-python-host.md` |
| PyO3 hooks (in-proc) | Python runs inside xcodex via PyO3 | Advanced power users; trusted code only | `docs/xcodex/hooks-pyo3.md` |

## Performance

Measured via `hooks_perf` (release build, Python `3.11.14`, payload `373` bytes), repeated 3 times:

| Mode | Approx cost | Throughput |
|---|---:|---:|
| External hook (Python per-event spawn) | ~20.87–21.48 ms/event | ~47–48 ev/s |
| Python Host (persistent “py-box”) | ~1.88–1.90 µs/event | ~526k–532k ev/s |
| In-proc PyO3 | ~1.38–1.45 µs/event | ~690k–725k ev/s |

Larger payloads (dominant costs: JSON serialization + Python JSON parsing for Host; PyO3 avoids per-event `json.loads`):

| Payload size | External spawn | Python Host (“py-box”) | In-proc PyO3 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ~12 KB (`12040` bytes) | 20.98–22.07 ms/event | 11.71–12.85 µs/event | 2.09–2.48 µs/event |
| ~20 KB (`20040` bytes) | 21.80–22.37 ms/event | 17.41–19.55 µs/event | 2.35–2.84 µs/event |
| ~200 KB (`200040` bytes) | 24.03–24.51 ms/event | 162.56–170.48 µs/event | 12.19–13.49 µs/event |

To reproduce locally:

```sh
cd codex-rs
PY=$(command -v python3.11)
PYO3_PYTHON=$PY cargo run -p codex-core --bin hooks_perf --release --features pyo3-hooks -- --python "$PY" --iters 20000 --warmup 2000 --external-iters 200 --payload-bytes 373 --markdown
```

Use `--payload-bytes 12020`, `20020`, and `200020` to reproduce the larger-payload rows.

## Quickstart (install + test)

```sh
xcodex hooks init
xcodex hooks list
xcodex hooks paths

xcodex hooks install sdks list
xcodex hooks install samples list

xcodex hooks test external --configured-only
xcodex hooks test python-host --configured-only
xcodex hooks test pyo3 --configured-only
```

Use `--edit-config` with `xcodex hooks init` to have xcodex update `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` directly (best-effort), otherwise it prints a snippet to paste.

## Supported events

External hooks receive a single “payload object” per event (via stdin). The payload always includes:

- `schema_version`: currently `1`
- `event_id`: unique id for the event
- `timestamp`: RFC3339 timestamp
- `session_id`: session/thread id
- `cwd`: current working directory (best-effort)
- `hook_event_name`: the configured event name that triggered this hook (for `hooks.command`), or a default Claude-style name for other modes
- `xcodex_event_type`: canonical xcodex event type string (for example `tool-call-finished`)

Supported xcodex event types (via `xcodex_event_type`):

- `session-start`
- `session-end`
- `user-prompt-submit`
- `pre-compact`
- `notification`
- `subagent-stop`
- `model-request-started`
- `model-response-completed`
- `model-manual-apply`
- `model-training-mode`
- `tool-call-started`
- `tool-call-finished`
- `agent-turn-complete`
- `approval-requested`

The xcodex-only approval redirect events are emitted when the user explicitly chooses those patch-review paths in the approval UI:

- `model-manual-apply`: user chose `Manual apply in editor`
- `model-training-mode`: user chose `Training Mode`

Event parity: these same event types are emitted regardless of hook mode (external, Python Host, or PyO3). Python Host wraps the payload in a JSONL object with an `event` field; the `event` value is the same payload object external hooks receive.

## Payload samples

Minimal example (tool call finished):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "event_id": "evt-...",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-11T23:59:59Z",
  "session_id": "thread-...",
  "turn_id": "turn-...",
  "cwd": "/path/to/repo",
  "hook_event_name": "tool_call_finished",
  "xcodex_event_type": "tool-call-finished",
  "tool_name": "exec_command",
  "tool_input": { "cmd": "rg -n \"hooks\" README.md" },
  "duration_ms": 123,
  "success": true,
  "output_preview": "…"
}
```

Python Host (“py-box”) receives JSONL lines that wrap the same payload:

```json
{"schema_version":1,"type":"event","seq":1,"event":{"xcodex_event_type":"tool-call-finished","tool_name":"exec_command","tool_input":{"cmd":"…"}}}
```

See `docs/xcodex/hooks.schema.json` for the full payload schema.

Approval requested example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "event_id": "evt-...",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-11T23:59:59Z",
  "session_id": "thread-...",
  "cwd": "/path/to/repo",
  "hook_event_name": "approval_requested",
  "xcodex_event_type": "approval-requested",
  "kind": "exec",
  "command": "rm -rf node_modules",
  "proposed_execpolicy_amendment": null
}
```

## Configuration

See `docs/config.md#hooks` for the full config surface. High-level:

- External hooks: prefer `hooks.command` (matcher + per-hook options); legacy `[hooks]` argv arrays are still supported.
- Python Host hooks: configure `[hooks.host]` and a `command = [...]` argv to start the host process.
- PyO3 hooks: require `hooks.enable_unsafe_inproc = true`, `hooks.inproc = ["pyo3"]`, and a separately-built PyO3-enabled binary.
- Compatibility: see `docs/xcodex/hooks-claude-compat.md`.

### Common setup patterns

External hooks (spawn per event) using `hooks.command`:

```toml
[hooks.command]
default_timeout_sec = 30

[[hooks.command.tool_call_finished]]
matcher = "write_file|edit_block"
  [[hooks.command.tool_call_finished.hooks]]
  argv = ["python3", "/absolute/path/to/tool_call_summary.py"]
  timeout_sec = 10
```

Python Host (“py-box”):

```toml
[hooks.host]
enabled = true
command = ["python3", "-u", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/host/python/host.py", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/host/python/example_hook.py"]
```

Replace `/Users/alice/.xcodex` with your `CODEX_HOME` (see `xcodex hooks paths`). Relative paths also work because the host process runs with `cwd=CODEX_HOME`.

PyO3 (in-process; requires separate build):

```toml
[hooks]
enable_unsafe_inproc = true
inproc = ["pyo3"]

[hooks.pyo3]
script_path = "hooks/pyo3_hook.py"
callable = "on_event"
```

### Hooks config reference (keys + variations)

This is a quick, “everything hooks-related” cheat sheet. The canonical source remains `docs/config.md#hooks`.

- External (legacy argv arrays):
  - `hooks.agent_turn_complete`, `hooks.approval_requested`, `hooks.session_start`, `hooks.session_end`
  - `hooks.user_prompt_submit`, `hooks.pre_compact`, `hooks.notification`, `hooks.subagent_stop`
  - `hooks.model_request_started`, `hooks.model_response_completed`
  - `hooks.model_manual_apply`, `hooks.model_training_mode`
  - `hooks.tool_call_started`, `hooks.tool_call_finished`
- External (recommended matcher config):
  - `hooks.command.default_timeout_sec`
  - `hooks.command.<event>`: matcher entries; each entry has `matcher = "..."` and `hooks = [{ argv | command, timeout_sec?, payload? }]`
  - `hooks.command.<event>.hooks[*].payload`: `xcodex` | `claude` (use `claude` only when running scripts that expect Claude-shaped JSON)
- In-process built-ins (Rust):
  - `hooks.inproc = ["tool_call_summary"]` / `["event_log_jsonl"]`
  - `hooks.inproc_tool_call_summary = true` (back-compat alias)
- PyO3 in-process (advanced; separate build):
  - `hooks.enable_unsafe_inproc = true` (required gate)
  - `hooks.pyo3.script_path`, `hooks.pyo3.callable`, `hooks.pyo3.batch_size`, `hooks.pyo3.timeout_sec`
  - `hooks.pyo3.filters.<event>` (optional matcher filters; same semantics as `hooks.command`)
- Python Host (“py-box”, persistent process):
  - `hooks.host.enabled = true`
  - `hooks.host.command = ["python3", "-u", "..."]`
  - `hooks.host.sandbox_mode` (optional override; otherwise inherits the session sandbox policy)
  - `hooks.host.timeout_sec` (optional per-event write timeout)
  - `hooks.host.filters.<event>` (optional matcher filters; same semantics as `hooks.command`)
- Delivery/retention:
  - `hooks.max_stdin_payload_bytes` (above this, hooks receive a `payload_path` envelope)
  - `hooks.keep_last_n_payloads` (prunes hook payload/log files under `CODEX_HOME/tmp/hooks/`)
- `hooks.sanitize_payloads` (redact sensitive content before hook dispatch; default true)

## Where hook code lives

Hook code is **not required** to live in `CODEX_HOME`, but some modes have convenient defaults.

- External hooks (spawn per event):
  - Your hook is configured either in `hooks.command` (recommended) or legacy `[hooks]` argv arrays (for example `["python3", "/absolute/path/hook.py"]`).
  - The script/binary can live anywhere, but you should prefer **absolute paths** so it works no matter what directory you run `xcodex` from.
- Python Host (long-lived):
  - Your host is started via `hooks.host.command = [...]`.
  - The host process is spawned with `cwd=CODEX_HOME`, so **relative paths in the argv are resolved from `CODEX_HOME`**.
  - The host can load hook scripts from anywhere (absolute paths) or from within `CODEX_HOME` (relative paths).
- PyO3 (in-process):
  - Your Python hook is configured via `hooks.pyo3.script_path`.
  - If it’s relative, it’s resolved as `CODEX_HOME/<path>`. If it’s absolute, it can live anywhere.
  - Optional batching: if you set `hooks.pyo3.batch_size = N` (N>1) and your script defines `on_events(events: list[dict]) -> None`, xcodex will call `on_events` with batches (otherwise it falls back to `on_event(event: dict)`).

## Payload delivery (stdin + file fallback)

For small payloads, xcodex writes the full JSON payload to stdin.

For large payloads, xcodex writes the full payload JSON to a file under `CODEX_HOME` and writes a small JSON envelope to stdin containing `payload_path`. Hook scripts should handle both cases.

While the TUI is running, hook stdout/stderr are redirected to log files under `CODEX_HOME` so hooks do not corrupt the terminal UI.

## Installation helpers (SDKs + samples)

xcodex ships “installer” commands that copy templates into your `CODEX_HOME`:

- Typed SDKs: `xcodex hooks install sdks <sdk|all|list>`
- Runnable samples: `xcodex hooks install samples <external|python-host|pyo3|all|list>`

See:

- `docs/xcodex/hooks-sdks.md`
- `docs/xcodex/hooks-gallery.md`

## Testing hooks before running a session

You can exercise your configured hooks with synthetic events, without waiting for real session events:

- External hooks: `xcodex hooks test external` (spawns your configured `hooks.command` and legacy `[hooks]` commands).
- Python Host: `xcodex hooks test python-host` (spawns your configured `hooks.host.command`, sends one JSONL event, then expects a clean exit).
- PyO3: `xcodex hooks test pyo3` is a configuration/gating preflight; to actually execute the PyO3 hook, run the PyO3-enabled binary and trigger real events.

Logs and payload dumps are written under `CODEX_HOME/tmp/hooks/`. Run `xcodex hooks paths` to see the exact directories.

## Command reference

Run `xcodex hooks help` for the full, up-to-date list. Common commands:

- `xcodex hooks init [external|python-host|pyo3]`
- `xcodex hooks install sdks <sdk|all|list> [--dry-run] [--force] [--yes]`
- `xcodex hooks install samples <external|python-host|pyo3|all|list> [--dry-run] [--force] [--yes]`
- `xcodex hooks list`
- `xcodex hooks paths`
- `xcodex hooks doctor <external|python-host|pyo3>`
- `xcodex hooks test <external|python-host|pyo3|all> [--configured-only]`
- `xcodex hooks build pyo3`

## Compatibility policy (payload schema)

This policy applies to:

- hook authors (scripts you run via `[hooks]`)
- “typed hook SDKs” (helpers/templates/types that parse the hook JSON)

`schema_version` is currently `1`.

Payload shape changes are not backwards compatible by default. External hook consumers should parse defensively and treat unknown fields as ignorable.

External hook consumers should be forward compatible:

- treat unknown fields as ignorable
- prefer optional access patterns and safe defaults
