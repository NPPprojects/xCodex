# This project is archived.

- Originally I forked this repo with the intent of building a notification system within my Arch config. 
- The idea was to keep track of Codex CLI agent status, and the fork by  Eriz1818/xCodex was the only available fork, that had decent hook support. As of writing this 29/04/2026, Codex CLI upstream still has poor hook support. In addition both this fork and its upstream is vastly behind the Codex Cli upstream, and model access is limited to gpt 5.4 variants and lower. 
- For better long term support, I've migrated all my systems to OpenCode, where I run an easy to maintain fork.



# xCodex (xtreme-Codex)

`xCodex` (short for “xtreme-Codex”) is an independent fork of OpenAI’s Codex CLI.

- Repo: `xCodex`
- Binary: `xcodex`
- Upstream: https://github.com/openai/codex

`xCodex` is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by OpenAI.

## Status / stability

This is a fast-moving fork. Some features are experimental, may be incomplete, and can be temporarily broken. Expect rough edges, churn, and occasional behavior changes.

When filing issues, include repro steps and attach the files printed by `/feedback`.

## Highlights

**New in xCodex**

- **Context Control**: Keep context under control with `/compact` and `/autocompact` (see the [Context control guide](docs/xcodex/compact.md)).
- **Agent Thoughts**: Hide/show agent thoughts in the TUI with `/thoughts` (see the [Thoughts guide](docs/xcodex/thoughts.md)).
- **Git Worktrees**: Switch a session between git worktrees with `/worktree` and manage shared dirs (see the [Worktrees guide](docs/xcodex/worktrees.md)).
- **⚡Tools**: Open ⚡Tools with `Ctrl+O` (or `/xtreme`) and customize the status bar with `/settings` (see the [Settings guide](docs/xcodex/settings.md)).
- **UI Theme**: Customize the UI theme with `/theme` and `$CODEX_HOME/themes` (including themed syntax highlighting for code) (see the [Theme guide](docs/xcodex/themes.md) and [theme config reference](docs/config.md#themes)).
- **Transcript Rendering**: Toggle transcript rendering features like diff highlighting, highlighting past prompts, and syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks (see the [Settings guide](docs/xcodex/settings.md)).
- **Hooks**: Automate xcodex with **three levels of hooks**: external (spawn), Python Host “py-box” (persistent), and in-proc PyO3 (advanced) (start with the [Hooks guide](docs/xcodex/hooks.md)).
- **Background Terminals**: Manage background terminals with `/ps` (list) and `/ps-kill` (terminate) (see the [Background terminals guide](docs/xcodex/background-terminals.md)).
- **MCP Servers**: Inspect and manage MCP servers from inside the TUI with `/mcp` (including startup status, timings, and retry hints) (see the [MCP config reference](docs/config.md#mcp_servers)).
- **Lazy MCP Loading**: Speed up startup by deferring MCP server startup with lazy/manual modes (see the [Lazy MCP loading guide](docs/xcodex/lazy-mcp-loading.md) and [MCP integration config reference](docs/config.md#mcp-integration)).
- **Ignore Files**: Keep sensitive paths out of AI context with ignore files (`.aiexclude` / `.xcodexignore`) and control exclusion behavior with `/exclusion` (see the [Ignore files guide](docs/xcodex/ignore-files.md) and [Exclusion config reference](docs/config.md#exclusion-sensitive-path-controls)).
- **TUI2**: TUI2 still lives :)

**Fork-only docs**

Fork-specific docs live in `docs/xcodex/` (start at the [xCodex docs index](docs/xcodex/README.md)).

## Roadmap

High-level roadmap (subject to change):

- `v0.1.0` ✅: hooksv1
- `v0.2.0` ✅: hooksv2, worktree v2
- `v0.3.0` ✅: soft block + themes (highlight composer + diff highlight + ...)
- `v0.3.1` ✅: fork health (feature inventory + E2E tests + merge prep)
- `v0.3.5` ✅: resume/startup responsiveness + themed syntax highlighting + small QoL/bug fixes
- `v0.3.6` ✅: TUI exclusion controls(`/exclusion` command), transcript rendering fixes, and GPT-5.3 Codex support
- `v0.4.0` ✅: plan mode + split diff mode + approval-flow reliability + worktree/exclusion UX polish
- `v0.5.0`: observer-only sub-agents
- `v0.6.0`: infinite mode (built on `/plan`)
- `v0.7.0`: hooks expansion (beyond observer-only)
- `v0.8.0`: workflow + packaging (per-project profiles, runbooks/macros, approval policy profiles, multi-account)
- `v0.9.0`: UX/theming/integrations
- `v1.0.0`: stability milestone

## Quickstart

This fork ships an npm distribution (recommended) and also supports building from source.

### Install (npm)

```bash
npm i -g @eriz1818/xcodex
xcodex --version
xcodex
```

Prereleases are published under the `alpha` dist-tag:

```bash
npm i -g @eriz1818/xcodex@alpha
```

### Install (build from source)

See [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md) for full requirements; the shortest path is:

```bash
# from repo root
cargo install just

# builds codex-rs and installs the CLI as `xcodex` (default: ~/.local/bin/xcodex)
cd codex-rs
just xcodex-install --release

# Default: local Bazel build (no BuildBuddy/remote cache).
# Opt into remote cache/BEP: just xcodex-install --release --remote
# Avoid all network fetches (requires deps already cached): just xcodex-install --release --offline

xcodex --version
xcodex
```

If you prefer not to use `just`, run:

```bash
scripts/install-xcodex.sh --release
```

## Usage

See `xcodex --help` (or `docs/getting-started.md`).

## Docs

Codex can access MCP servers. To configure them, refer to the [config docs](./docs/config.md#mcp_servers).

### Large prompts (stdin / file)

For large prompts, avoid putting the prompt on the command line. Read it from a file or stdin instead:

```bash
xcodex --file PROMPT.md
cat PROMPT.md | xcodex
```

When using stdin, end input with EOF (Ctrl-D on macOS/Linux; Ctrl-Z then Enter on Windows).

### Hooks (automation)

Hooks can receive event payloads containing metadata like `cwd`, and may include truncated tool output previews. Treat hook payloads/logs as potentially sensitive.

**What xcodex supports**

- Hooks (3 levels): external (spawn), Python Host “py-box” (persistent), and PyO3 (in-proc; separate build).
- Typed hook SDK installers: `xcodex hooks install sdks <sdk>` (Python/Rust/JavaScript/TypeScript/Go/Ruby/Java).

**Performance (rough numbers)**

Measured on macOS 26.2 (arm64), Python 3.11 (event: `tool-call-finished`, payload: 373 bytes):

```bash
cd codex-rs
PYO3_PYTHON=$(command -v python3.11) cargo run -p codex-core --bin hooks_perf --release --features pyo3-hooks -- --python $(command -v python3.11) --iters 20000 --warmup 2000 --external-iters 200 --markdown
```

- External hook (Python, per-event spawn): ~20.2ms/event (includes `serde_json::to_string` + `json.loads`)
- Out-of-proc host (Python, persistent): ~1.98µs/event (JSONL over stdin; includes `serde_json::to_string` + `json.loads`)
- In-proc baseline: ~0.33ns/iter (Rust loop only)
- In-proc PyO3: ~2.22µs/event (includes `serde_json::to_string` + `json.loads` + Python callable)

Start here:

- Hook configuration + supported events: `docs/xcodex/hooks.md`.
- External hooks (spawn-per-event): `docs/xcodex/hooks-external.md`.
- Typed hook SDKs + installers (Python/Rust/JS/TS/Go/Ruby/Java): `docs/xcodex/hooks-sdks.md`.
- Python Host hooks (long-lived “python box”): `docs/xcodex/hooks-python-host.md`.
- PyO3 hooks (in-process; separately built): `docs/xcodex/hooks-pyo3.md`.
- Copy/paste scripts: `examples/hooks/` and `docs/xcodex/hooks-gallery.md`.
- CLI helpers: `xcodex hooks help`, `xcodex hooks init`, `xcodex hooks install sdks list`, `xcodex hooks install samples list`.

### Configuration

Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (default: `~/.xcodex/config.toml` when invoked as `xcodex`). For full configuration options, see [Configuration](./docs/config.md).

### Execpolicy

See the [Execpolicy quickstart](./docs/execpolicy.md) to set up rules that govern what commands Codex can execute.
